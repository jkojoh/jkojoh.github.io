I am a computer science student at California State University of Fullerton and I expect to graduate in 2027.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1, Part 1

Although this was a simple lab, I loved it because it was the start to my coding journey. Coming from the lecture, I was still confused because there was a lot to learn, but the README provided step by step instructions. I’m glad we started with a basic code that is done by many coders. This lab was my first coding project and I was able to use Github, which I had never accessed before.

Lab 4, Part 2

I enjoyed this lab because it was fun to create a mini guessing game. Here, I learned how to utilize “if” statements in my code. I found out about the student center because of this lab and was able to get the proper help I needed when I was stuck. Overall, it was a good introduction to “if” statements that were easy and fun to learn thanks to the mini game.

Lab 6, Part 1

Here, we revisited the game of MadLibs and created sandwich orders. I liked this lab because like Lab 4, I was able to learn through silly games. From this lab, I learned that computers are great at following patterns, just like the ones we input through our code.
